## 1. Purpose

Hyggshi OS Developer Platform exists to explore, design, and build a unique virtual operating system experience.

This project is driven by creativity, experimentation, and community collaboration. It is not intended to replicate existing operating systems, but to provide its own independent identity and direction.

---

## 2. Core Principles

### Creative Freedom

Developers and contributors are encouraged to create, experiment, and innovate. Hyggshi OS is a platform for learning, exploration, and creative expression.

### Independent Identity

Hyggshi OS maintains its own design philosophy and does not aim to clone or impersonate existing operating systems.

### User-Centered Experience

Usability, clarity, interactivity, and accessibility are prioritized to ensure a positive and engaging experience.

### Transparency and Respect

All contributors, users, and community members should be treated with respect. Contributions remain valid regardless of tools, workflows, or development methods used.

---

## 3. Project Integrity and Attribution

The identity, authorship, and origin of Hyggshi OS must be respected.

Contributors and developers may build upon Hyggshi OS in accordance with the applicable license and community policies.

However, projects must not misrepresent themselves as the original Hyggshi OS project or claim false official status.

Proper attribution helps preserve project history and ensures transparency within the community.

---

## 4. Brand and Identity Protection

The name "Hyggshi OS" represents the identity of the original project.

Use of the name should avoid causing confusion between official releases and independent community projects.

Community projects are encouraged to use clear naming such as:

> "[Project Name] – A project based on Hyggshi OS"

This helps maintain clarity while supporting open development.

This statement serves as a community guideline and project orientation, not as a legal enforcement document.

---

## 5. Community and Ecosystem Vision

Hyggshi OS is intended to grow as an open and collaborative ecosystem.

Goals include:

* Encouraging learning and experimentation
* Supporting community-created extensions and mods
* Providing a platform for creative technical projects
* Building a respectful and collaborative environment

Community participation is welcomed and valued.

## 6. Scope and Limitations

This document does not grant or revoke legal rights by itself.

---

## 7. Long-Term Vision

Hyggshi OS aims to become a lasting creative and technical project that demonstrates innovation, openness, and collaboration.

Its long-term value lies not only in the software itself, but also in the community and ideas built around it.
