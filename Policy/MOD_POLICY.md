Version 2.0
Last updated: February 23, 2026

## 1. Purpose

This policy explains how members of the Roblox and developer community may create mods or derivative versions of **Hyggshi OS** if:

* The project is discontinued, or
* The source code is publicly released.

The goal is to encourage creativity while maintaining proper attribution and brand clarity.

---

## 2. What You Are Allowed To Do

If the source materials are publicly available, you may:

* Create non-commercial mods or derivative versions.
* Use publicly shared assets (UI, icons, Lua scripts, sounds, etc.).
* Publish your mod for free on Roblox, GitHub, or similar platforms.

This permission only applies to content that has been officially released or made public.

---

## 3. Restrictions

You may not:

* Sell or monetize the mod without written permission.
* Claim to be the original creator of Hyggshi OS.
* Remove or alter author credits in the interface or source files.
* Reuse Hyggshi OS assets in unrelated projects without permission.
* Use closed-source builds or private beta components without authorization.

Violations may result in moderation actions within official Hyggshi OS spaces.

---

## 4. Respectful Tool Usage & Community Conduct

All contributors are expected to maintain respectful behavior.

Harassment or discrimination based on development methods, tools, or technologies (including AI-assisted tools) is not allowed.

This includes:

* Mocking someone for using AI or automation.
* Claiming that work is invalid solely because of tool usage.
* Repeatedly accusing or speculating about someone’s tools in a disruptive way.

Transparency means being honest about intent — it does not require disclosing every tool used.

Moderators may issue warnings, remove messages, or restrict access if necessary.

---

## 5. Name & Branding Guidelines

To avoid confusion:

* Do not use “Hyggshi” or “Hyggshi OS” in the title of your mod without permission.
* Do not present your mod as official.
* Do not imply endorsement or affiliation unless approved.

Recommended format for mods:

> “[Project Name] – A Mod Based on Hyggshi OS”

This keeps branding clear while allowing creative freedom.

If confusion or impersonation occurs, you may be asked to rename your project.

---

## 6. Attribution Requirement

All mods must include:

> “Based on Hyggshi OS by Nguyen Minh Phuc. Mod version by [Your Name].”

This notice must remain visible in documentation or credits.

---

## 7. Liability

The original author is not responsible for issues, damages, or policy violations caused by third-party mods.

All derivative works must comply with Roblox Terms of Service and applicable laws.

---

## 8. Commercial Licensing

For commercial usage or partnership discussions, contact:

* Roblox: Hyggshi / rbtfjt
* Discord: @hyggshi
* Email: [hyggshidev@gmail.com](mailto:hyggshidev@gmail.com)
