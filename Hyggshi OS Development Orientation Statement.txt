Author: Nguyen Minh Phuc
Project name: Hyggshi OS Developer Platform

1. 🎯 Core objectives
Hyggshi OS Developer Platform was created not to compete, but to inspire. The project aims to recreate the experience of a virtual operating system that is fun, highly interactive, creative and has a unique style, helping developers and users create new and interesting applications in an open and accessible environment.

2. 💡 Development philosophy
Freedom of creation: Users and developers can freely create and experiment, without being limited by rigid rules.

Not following trends: Hyggshi OS will not be dominated by trendy trends, but will always maintain its own identity.

Focus on experience: Hyggshi OS will always aim for ease of use, friendly interface and high interactivity.

3. 🚫 What Hyggshi OS will not do
Not become a paid platform: Hyggshi OS will not apply the pay-to-win model or force users to pay for basic features.

Not copy real operating systems: Although called an “OS”, Hyggshi OS will not emulate real operating systems but will keep a distinct character.

No advertising and user data collection: Hyggshi OS will not contain advertising and will not collect user data without explicit consent.

We do not allow changing the author's name. It is always our top priority to protect the brand and author's name.

4. 🧠 Community vision
Hyggshi OS is not just an operating system, but a community where users can share, learn and create. Each member of the community is an important part in the development and completion of this operating system.

Collaboration and Support: Hyggshi OS will create an open space for the community to develop new tools, games, applications and features.

5. 🛡️ When there are offers to acquire or cooperate
Ensure independence: Hyggshi OS will never sell or transfer ownership without ensuring that the core principles of the project are maintained.

Selective cooperation: Only cooperate with partners who respect the project's vision and do not interfere with the development direction of Hyggshi OS.

6. 🔥 The legacy that Hyggshi OS wants to leave
Hyggshi OS will be a legacy of creativity, freedom and innovation. The project will be a platform for developers and users to create valuable products together, promote progress and share within the community.

💡 Conclusion
Hyggshi OS Developer Platform is not just a software project, but a mission to create a strong, creative and sustainable development ecosystem. The project will not follow the market or trends but focus on building a free, friendly and collaborative platform. Let's build the future of Hyggshi OS together!
